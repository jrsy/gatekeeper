This project was built off of a default .NET/Vue.js template. For the purposes of code review the files I wrote are:

gatekeeper.client\src\components\AccountsTable.vue
GateKeeper.Server\Controllers\GateKeeperController.cs
GateKeeper.Server\Models\Account.cs
GateKeeper.Server\Models\AccountMessageQueue.cs
GateKeeper.Server\Models\GateKeeper.cs
GateKeeper.Server\Models\Message.cs
GateKeeper.Server\Models\User.cs

And the entire GateKeeperTests project. The backend project is complete, along with functioning unit tests.

I wasn't able to complete the front end, but it contains basic functionality. Which allows you to create accounts, users, and send messages.
